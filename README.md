# WeatherApp

WeatherApp is a weather app. Here I wanted to make a beginner application that shows the daily weather conditions of some capitals and the Min and Max temperatures for the coming days. I got the weather information from the api and set it according to my own model in my application.

In this project, I wanted to improve myself in the following technologies.

## Technologies
- UIKit
- Alamofire
- Kingfisher
